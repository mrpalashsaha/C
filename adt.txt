ADT is an extentional specification , is something that tells yo properties of the type and how you interect with the type and what the type 
appears to be likeand we never going to the details what the type actually is ..if we tell you what the type actually is thats call concrete 
type.. we dont phicially care what it is, we just want something that meets the specification. All i care about is how yout stack behave i dont a
actually care what under the hood ...
