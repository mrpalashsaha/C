you put something and expecting to get somthing but the function does somthing different than you have expected thats call side effect. 
For example in the function side effect is printf, the only reason we are doing printf just to display something on the screen it does not return anything.
the function that does not return anything at all call void(means nothing) function.
++ = incriment function it increase by one 
for example 
  int x;
  x= 6;
  x++;
  printf("%d", x),

  y = x++; ( it give the value first and increase it later)
  y = ++x; ( it will increase the vale before it return.
