you put something and expecting to get somthing but the function does somthing different than you have expected thats call side effect. 
For example in the function side effect is printf, the only reason we are doing printf just to display something on the screen it does not return anything.
the function that does not return anything at all call void(means nothing) function.
++ = incriment function it increase by one 
for example 
  int x;
  x= 6;
  x++;
  printf("%d", x),

  y = x++; ( it give the value first and increase it later)
  y = ++x; ( it will increase the vale before it return.
  
  

//& x = address of x) (the value of the cell *x) idirect addressing (*x = the value store in the x in this case *2, which refer to value of
// the cell 2 which will print the value of the cell 2

// pass by refference means sharing the same value and pass by value means copy the value and work on it differently
// C always pass the refence of the Array,
